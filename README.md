# Back4App React Slack Clone

Complete Guide here: https://www.back4app.com/docs/react/real-time/react-chat-app

This [React](https://reactjs.org/) app uses [Parse Server](https://parseplatform.org/) through [Back4App](https://www.back4app.com/) to create a Slack clone, with user management, text channels and chat messaging. It also uses the [`@parse/react`](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-react/tree/master/packages/parse-react) hook to enable Live Query and live updates on the app.

## Back4App Setup

Sign up to [Back4App](https://www.back4app.com/) or log in with your existing account. Create a new app utilizing the `back4app/SlackClone` DB from the DatabaseHub, naming it whatever you like it. Let's now retrieve some key values to enable the integration of your Back4App app with this React example.

### Parse Application ID and Parse JavaScript Key

In your Back4App dashboard, navigate to "App Settings -> Security & Keys" and write down the `Application ID` and `JavaScript Key` values.

### Parse Live Query URL

Navigate to "App Settings -> Server Settings -> Server URL and Live Query". Activate your free Back4App subdomain and then activate Live Query, remenbering to activate it on the `Channel` and `Message` classes. Write down the complete Back4App subdomain, as it will be your `Parse Live Query URL` value.

## Local Installation Instructions

Make sure you have [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) properly installed and configured on your local environment, as well as [`git`](https://git-scm.com/). Clone this repository to your machine using `git` and open the project's code in your favorite code editor.

Create a new file in the project root directory called `.env` with the following content, filling the environmental variables values with your own app information:

```plain
REACT_APP_PARSE_APPLICATION_ID = "YOUR PARSE APPLICATION ID"
REACT_APP_PARSE_JAVASCRIPT_KEY = "YOUR PARSE JAVASCRIPT KEY"
REACT_APP_PARSE_LIVE_QUERY_URL = "YOUR PARSE LIVE QUERY URL"
```

Save the file and run the following commands in your command line to install all project dependencies and finally start the app in development mode on your browser.

```plain
yarn install
yarn start
```

That's it, your Slack clone should be running fine now!
